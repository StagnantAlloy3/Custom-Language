Custom Compiler
===============

The goal of this project was to build our own code interpreter for a specified made-up language.  It was written in C++ for efficiency. This program encompasses the five stages in code compilation, the Preprocessor, Compiler, Assembler, and Linker.  It is not fully working, often giving erroneous output, however it was a challenging exercise and grew a better understanding of the execution lifecycle.
